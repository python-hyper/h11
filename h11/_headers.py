# Facts
# -----
#
# Headers are:
#   keys: case-insensitive ascii
#   values: mixture of ascii and raw bytes
#
# "Historically, HTTP has allowed field content with text in the ISO-8859-1
# charset [ISO-8859-1], supporting other charsets only through use of
# [RFC2047] encoding.  In practice, most HTTP header field values use only a
# subset of the US-ASCII charset [USASCII]. Newly defined header fields SHOULD
# limit their field values to US-ASCII octets.  A recipient SHOULD treat other
# octets in field content (obs-text) as opaque data."
# And it deprecates all non-ascii values
#
# Leading/trailing whitespace in header names is forbidden
#
# Values get leading/trailing whitespace stripped
#
# Content-Disposition actually needs to contain unicode semantically; to
# accomplish this it has a terrifically weird way of encoding the filename
# itself as ascii (and even this still has lots of cross-browser
# incompatibilities)
#
# Order is important:
# "a proxy MUST NOT change the order of these field values when forwarding a
# message"
# (and there are several headers where the order indicates a preference)
#
# Multiple occurences of the same header:
# "A sender MUST NOT generate multiple header fields with the same field name
# in a message unless either the entire field value for that header field is
# defined as a comma-separated list [or the header is Set-Cookie which gets a
# special exception]" - RFC 7230. (cookies are in RFC 6265)
#
# So every header aside from Set-Cookie can be merged by b", ".join if it
# occurs repeatedly. But, of course, they can't necessarily be split by
# .split(b","), because quoting.
#
# Given all this mess (case insensitive, duplicates allowed, order is
# important, ...), there doesn't appear to be any standard way to handle
# headers in Python -- they're almost like dicts, but... actually just
# aren't. For now we punt and just use a super simple representation: headers
# are a list of pairs
#
#   [(name1, value1), (name2, value2), ...]
#
# where all entries are bytestrings, names are lowercase and have no
# leading/trailing whitespace, and values are bytestrings with no
# leading/trailing whitespace. Searching and updating are done via naive O(n)
# methods.
#
# Maybe a dict-of-lists would be better?

    #
    # Content-Length: technically is just a single value (1*DIGIT), but the
    # standard makes reference to implementations that do multiple values, and
    # using this doesn't hurt. Ditto, case insensitivity doesn't things either
    # way.
    #
    # Transfer-Encoding: is more complex (allows for quoted strings), so
    # splitting on , is actually wrong. For example, this is legal:
    #
    #    Transfer-Encoding: foo; options="1,2", chunked
    #
    # and should be parsed as
    #
    #    foo; options="1,2"
    #    chunked

    # but this naive function will parse it as
    #
    #    foo; options="1
    #    2"
    #    chunked
    #
    # However, this is okay because the only thing we are going to do with
    # any Transfer-Encoding is reject ones that aren't just "chunked", so
    # both of these will be treated the same anyway.
    #
    # Expect: the only legal value is the literal string
    # "100-continue". Splitting on commas is harmless. But, must set
    # lowercase=False.
